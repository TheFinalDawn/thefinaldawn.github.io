        <h6><i>For the formal folk</i></h6>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my website. My name online is Resetium, or Reset. I am a high school sophomore at Graham-Kapowsin High School, and I like playing various video games (rhythm games being a notable portion of them). I am a diligent (if sometimes
            easily distractable) individual who appreciates the value of hard work, persistence, and the mind's sheer potential for learning.
            <br> My skill comes from a powerful motivation to learn, adapt, and constantly improve. I'm an ambitious individual who rarely intends to ever stop until I have achieved whatever goal I set out to accomplish, leveraging my adaptability to
            my advantage to conquer whatever challenges life may throw at me.
            <br> Furthermore, I make it my top priority to be as kind as possible to others, for only those that sabotage others are the ones that should ever be left behind.
            <br> I am noteworthy among my peers due to my exceptional efforts applied to perfect my performance in the classroom (with a GPA of 3.2 even after the pandemic, demonstrating my endurance through unexpected situations), along with ensuring
            I rarely get boring outside it.
            <br> With the about me section done, below is a list of projects I have made over the years.

                <br> So I coded a little celebration popup instead of a boring old card. It's a card, but cooler! <br> (also ignore the rest of the site please, I forgot to finish it. except maybe the last link, that one is cool.)</p>

<p>Day 507</p>

<p>The imprisonment never ends. The soldiers have us do everything for them at this point, it seems. We’re surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards, complete with batons and firearms. When it will end, I have no idea. It could never end for all we know. All we know is that we’re being punished for crimes Japan did, even though we have sworn loyalty to America. All we know is that the soldiers are terrible people. We’ve been getting bare-bones meals, nothing possibly good. They kill those who resist orders, others starve or die of illness. Still others die just from emotional shock.</p>

<p>I’ve been here for a year and a half now, and around 10 people have died from these causes.</p>

<p>They claim this to be a military necessity, but when did a Japanese American sabotage the country? Never.</p>

<p>I’m writing this because I’m going to make my escape. If the guards find this, let this be a slap to the face for them. If someone I know finds this, they’ll know what motivated me through all this planning. I will get out of here, whatever it takes to do so.</p>

<p>I’ll leave the details here. By the time someone reads this, I’ll have already escaped.</p>

<p>There’s a pile of boxes behind the mess hall, climb those to get on top, where you can do some building hopping to get to the fence. If you got on the right building, you should be level. Just jump over it, it’s an easy jump. Let this be the beginning of the escape. I hope to see you soon.</p>

<p>Day 1</p>

<p>At first I thought it was a joke. Nope! We’re actually getting kicked out of our homes and thrown in prison camps because we’re partially Japanese. I may not know a lot, but I’m pretty sure that’s racist against Japanese people. Oh, it doesn’t matter, because every Japanese person is a spy, obviously. The fact that we’re being attacked like this is just outrageous. “Land of Opportunity” my butt! Ok fine, I probably shouldn’t write that way. I’m still not erasing it, because people are entitled to their own opinions. The soldiers posted the schedule, and it turns out we have a bit of freedom. Lights on at 6 am, work shifts start at 9, end at 5, pretty boring schedule. Lights get shut off at 9 PM. Yeah it couldn’t get more boring. I’m tempted to… I’m actually not sure what I feel like doing against these people. They “confiscated” everyone’s radios, cameras, weapons, lots of stuff. The food is terrible, too. They froze my parent’s bank account, summary of all of this is that they made life miserable. Well, all I can really do is try and help everyone else stuck here, and try to stay in line (even if I despise doing so.) I really regret not bringing some other things, though I brought most of my stuff since I don’t have much. </p>

<p>Alright, it’s a few hours later, and already someone tried to attack a soldier. You can guess how that went! He’s in the medical area whatever thing, I never remember what they’re called. Trying to not spill stuff on this page… Why am I writing here again? Oops, I failed, there is now a stain on this page. Actually, that’s kind of cool how that landed… I’ll just keep that there then… </p>

<p>Returning Home</p>

<p>After a long battle, the 442nd combat team is returning home! They’ve given us over 18000 different awards for our service. “Go for Broke” is what we always said in the team. Even the 100th battalion joined us! We fought across Europe liberating everyone from the Germans, and I couldn’t be more proud. We even helped liberate France! To be completely honest, I’m surprised I made it out… We’re leaving tomorrow, on the same boat we got here on. Everybody is super happy to be returning to their families, and (what’s left of) their homes. Maybe now they’ll let the others out of the camps, now that we’ve proved our loyalty. Yes, that would be great. Sadly from what I’ve heard, the people back home are likely to have destroyed/vandalized our houses. Things can be forgiven though, right? They really should be nicer, we’re the most decorated military unit for a reason. Yep, the 100th is really good. </p>

<p>We just got news that several people earned the Medal of Honor! I can’t believe it, the Medal of Honor is the highest personal decoration you can get! The fact that America recognized our actions is just amazing…</p>

<p>Next day now, and we’re getting on the boat to come home. I’m excited to return home (didn’t I say this before?) and I’m hoping we’re treated better now. They better, honestly, we sacrificed everything for them. I fully expect my house to be at least vandalized, and I wish I could sigh in writing. If only…</p>

<p>I got a medal, so that’s nice.</p>
